Web Development | Assessment 2: Web Development Project

Created by Isaac Gerard Senoy Marquez

**Theme: Personal Portfolio**

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio! On this website, I will mainly showcase my background, my credentials and certificates, and my accomplishments and recent projects. 

I decided to create a portfolio to display and demonstrate the skills, knowledge, and experience I have with website development and different programming languages. And by having a portfolio that I can use in the future, I can show my future employers my progress and evolution as a Website developer, allowing them to see not only my current skills but also further potential for any future projects and opportunities that I may receive. This Web Development Portfolio will serve as a tool I can use to help me accomplish my goals and advance my future career in the ever-evolving world of web development.
